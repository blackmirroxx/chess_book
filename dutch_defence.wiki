== 1...f5 - Dutch Defence ==

The Dutch Defence has a character all of its own in contrast to other 1.d4 openings, which often share similar themes. Black usually plays variously for: 

* A Classical setup with 2...e6 3...d6 4...Be7, 
* A Stonewall with 2...e6 3...d5 4...c6, or 
* The Leningrad with 2...g6 3...Bg7 4...d6. 

White usually plays 2. g3 or 2. c4 here, though many moves are playable. 

One interesting though often considered dubious option is the Staunton Gambit with 2. e4, leading to more tactical positions than the positional grinds and straightforward attacks that the Dutch usually provides.

Because Black responds to 1.d4 with f5, breaking the symmetry, the Dutch is an example of a Semi-Closed Game. This means one player, but not both, has a fixed pawn in the center which implies that the center will be somewhat (but not completely) closed. The main purpose of the f5 push is to take control of the e4 square. The idea behind f5, typically followed by Nf6, is to prevent white from playing e4. However, white has several options that allow them to play e4 anyway. One way to achieve this is the Staunton Gambit where the move is simply played immediately. The Bladel Variation and the Raphael Variation are more sophisticated ways of playing e4. In most of these lines white plays Nc3 followed by e4.
