===6. Nf3===
Superficially the positions of white's knights look a bit like in the open Sicilians, except 
in the Sicilians the knights are look towards the queen side; but here both knights are looking towards king side. 
White has traded off a center pawn for a side pawn. White has now a lead in development. But black
has superior cards, provided that black survives the attack, in the end game. 
<br><br>
No matter what is played next, the lines will remain sharp. 
White has an edge in every line here. But black is not to far behind with ideas of counter play.
Black has noumerous ways to defend. White will have to ajust any attacking plans accordingly. 

== Black Responses ==

=== Rossmann Variation ===
'''6.Nf3 h6, 7.Bh4 d5 '''

White needs to decided where to put the knight next. Typically, it goes forward to Nc5.
Common continuations are  <br><br>
8.Nc5 Nf6, 9.c3 O-O, 10.Bb5 Ne4 <br><br>
Black castles short. White castles long. Both sides will end up pushing their pawns infront of their kings. 
Neither side is interested to trade of the queens any time soon. Black aims to gain the bishop pair. 
White aims to maintain the initiative. White's goal is to create an open file for the rook on d1.
