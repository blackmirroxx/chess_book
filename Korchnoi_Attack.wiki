== 2.h3 - Dutch Defence, Korchnoi Attack ==
The Korchnoi attack is a theory based, sound aggressive way to play against the Dutch. This Attack has been named after the Russian Grand Master: Viktor Lvovich Korchnoi. 

Viktor Lvovich Korchnoi (Russian: Виктор Львович Корчной, IPA: [vʲiktər lʲvovʲɪtɕ kɐrtɕˈnoj]; 23 March 1931 – 6 June 2016) was a Soviet (before 1976) and Swiss (after 1980) chess grandmaster (GM) and chess writer. He is considered one of the strongest players never to have become World Chess Champion.

Black has to respond differently right from the start. Black strongest responses are: 
* for the open variations with 2...d6 3...e5 4...Nc6,
* for the closed variations with 2...d5 3...c5 4...e6,
In both variation in the spirit of the Dutch Defence, black will fight in most sound and aggressive way possible. In the event of the open variations white can go for
* for the classic variation with 3.g6... 4.Bg5... 5.e5...
* for the normal variation with 3.Nf3... 4.c4... 5.Nc3...
* for the modern variation with 3.Nc3... 4.e5 fxe5 5.Nxe5...

In the case of the Dutch Defence, Korchnoi Attack, open Variations there is high probability to castle on opposing sites, which can lead to very exciting positions.
