===6. Nf3===
Superficially the positions of white's knights look a bit like in the open Sicilians, except 
in the Sicilians the knights are looking towards the queen side; but here both knights are looking towards king side. 
White has traded off a center pawn for a side pawn. White has now a lead in development. But black
has superior cards, provided that black survives the attack, in the end game. 
<br><br>
No matter what is played next, the lines will remain sharp. 
White has an edge in every line here. But black is not to far behind with ideas of counter play.
Black has noumerous ways to defend. White will have to ajust any attacking plans accordingly.

Common continuations are  <br><br>
8.Nc5 Nf6, 9.c3 O-O, 10.Bb5 Ne4 <br><br>
Black castles short. White castles long. Both sides will end up pushing their pawns infront of their kings.

White is going to push pawns on the king side later on. 
Black is going to meet this pushing pawns on the queen side. 
Both sides have castled on the opposite side. 
Common continuations are  <br><br>
21.b3 a5, 22.Ne3 a4, 23.b4 Bg6 <br><br>
Black tries to hold on to the bishop pair and open up the lines. 
White tries to trade the remaining bishop against the other one. White's
goal is than to create a strong knight vs weak bishop scenario. The position is unbalanced. 
This also a battle of ideas. White has a slide edge. But black has a point in terms of counter play.

White can either push the center and castle short or push king side and castle long. 
Common continuations are  <br><br>
8.Nxe5 Bxe5, 9.f4 Bxb2, 10.Rb1 Bg7, = <br><br>
8.h4 d6, 9.h5 Bf5, 10.Qe2 h6, +/=<br><br>
Most of the time of the time, as counter intuitive as it sounds, is allow black 
the chase down the queen side. This offers for white the plan with an even stronger 
attack on the king side. Black castles short. Whit castles long.
