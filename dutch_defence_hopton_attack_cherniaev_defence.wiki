= Dutch Defence: Hopton Attack, Cherniaev Defence =
===2. Bg5 Nc6===
Black choses a flexibel move. The intension is to avoid an early Nf6, which can be traded of by white. This is not in black interrest, because it weakens the kingside. 

== White Responses ==

=== Cherniev Defence, Perth Variation ===

White maintains the pin on the queen. For black it is easy to make a mistake and has contantly react with precision.
Black strongest reply is to opt for the Leningrad pawn structure and more importantly NOT to play Ng6. 
This leads to a trade which is not desired by black. Common continuations are 
4.Nc3 Bc7, 5.e3 d6, 6.Bc4 Bf6
White's idea is to prevent black to castle early and to make every move as hard as possible.
