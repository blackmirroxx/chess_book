Superficially the positions of white's knights look a bit like in the open Sicilians, except 
in the Sicilians the knights are look towards the queen side; but here both knights are looking towards king side. 
White has traded off a center pawn for a side pawn. White has now a lead in development. But black
has superior cards, provided that black survives the attack, in the end game.

No matter what is played next, the lines will remain sharp.

White maintains the pin on the queen. For black it is easy to make a mistake and has contantly react with precision.
Black's strongest reply is to opt for the Leningrad pawn structure and more importantly NOT to play Nf6 too early. 
This leads to a trade which is not desired by black. 
Common continuations are  <br><br>
