===6. Nf3===
Superficially the positions of white's knights look a bit like in the open Sicilians, except 
in the Sicilians the knights are looking towards the queen side; but here both knights are looking towards king side. 
White has traded off a center pawn for a side pawn. White has now a lead in development. But black
has superior cards, provided that black survives the attack, in the end game. 
<br><br>
No matter what is played next, the lines will remain sharp. 
White has an edge in every line here. But black is not to far behind with ideas of counter play.
Black has noumerous ways to defend. White will have to ajust any attacking plans accordingly.

White needs to decided where to put the knight next. Typically, it goes forward to Nc5.
Common continuations are  <br><br>
8.Nc5 Nf6, 9.c3 O-O, 10.Bb5 Ne4 <br><br>
Black castles short. White castles long. Both sides will end up pushing their pawns infront of their kings. 
Neither side is interested to trade of the queens any time soon. Black aims to gain the bishop pair. 
White aims to maintain the initiative. White's goal is to create an open file for the rook on d1.

White is going to push pawns on the king side later on. 
Black is going to meet this pushing pawns on the queen side. 
Both sides have castled on the opposite side. 
Common continuations are  <br><br>
21.b3 a5, 22.Ne3 a4, 23.b4 Bg6 <br><br>
Black tries to hold on to the bishop pair and open up the lines. 
White tries to trade the remaining bishop against the other one. White's
goal is than to create a strong knight vs weak bishop scenario. The position is unbalanced. 
This also a battle of ideas. White has a slide edge. But black has a point in terms of counter play.

White can either push the center and castle short or push king side and castle long. 
Common continuations are  <br><br>
8.Nxe5 Bxe5, 9.f4 Bxb2, 10.Rb1 Bg7, = <br><br>
8.h4 d6, 9.h5 Bf5, 10.Qe2 h6, +/=<br><br>
Most of the time of the time, as counter intuitive as it sounds, is to allow black 
to chase down the queen side. This offers for white the plan with an even stronger 
attack on the king side. Black castles short. White castles long.

Both sides have semi open files for each rook respectively. 
This is very unique for this position. White is going to push on king side. 
Black responds with a push on the queen side. 
Common continuations are  <br><br>
8.b3 Qxg6, 9.Nxg7 Nxc2, 10.Qxc2 Qxc2+, +/- <br><br>
This line is pretty much forced. Whoever deviates from this line is dead lost. There is no chance from comming back. 
With correct play, this game will end in a theoretical win for white, because of the bishop pair and being up in 
material. However making a move on either side is very difficult.

Both side try to develop and castle as quickly as possible. 
Common continuations are  <br><br>
8. Bb5 Nh6 9. Bxh6 Bxh6 10. Ne5 O-O +/= <br><br>
8. Qd2 Nxd4 9. Nxd4 Qxc5 10. Be3 Qd6  = <br><br>
8. c3 d5 9. Bb5 Ne7 10. Bxe7 Qxe7 = <br><br>
In this lines, white gives up both bishops, in order to create an outpost for each knight. 
Black casles short. White castles long. White has more center control and there fore has an edge. 
Despite opposite castle, the pawn push on opposite sides doesn't occure. Instead, every side follows their own agenda
Blach counters with the bishop pair along two diagonals. Therefore, black tries to open up the board. 
White tries to keep the positon as closed as posible. As a result of this, the game continues in a semi open game.
