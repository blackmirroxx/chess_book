= Dutch Defence: Hopton Attack, Leningrad Variation =
===2. Bg5 c6===
White can either keep the position closed with ideas of <br>
e3 ... h4 ... Nf3 <br>
Typically both sides castle short. 
This leads for more positional grinds.  <br> 

White can also go for more aggressive lines with Nc3 fallowed by a quick e4. 
This leads to open variations which most of the time in return do lead to modern variations of the Leningrad Variation within the Hopton attack. 
Both sides have a high chance of opposite castle, piece imbalances like a queen vs rook, 
knight and bishop vs rook and a pawn. Technically it is close to equal. However it can lead to razor sharp 
lines. White has an edge in every line here. But black is not to far behind with ideas of counter play.
