===2. Bg5 Nc6===
Black choses a flexibel move. The intension is to avoid an early Nf6, which can be traded of by white. This is not in black interrest, because it weakens the kingside.

White maintains the pin on the queen. For black it is easy to make a mistake and has contantly react with precision.
Black's strongest reply is to opt for the Leningrad pawn structure and more importantly NOT to play Nf6 too early. 
This leads to a trade which is not desired by black. Common continuations are  <br><br>
4.Nc3 Bc7, 5.e3 d6, 6.Bc4 Bf6 <br><br>
White's idea is to prevent black to castle early and to make every move as hard as possible.

White must **not** play Bh4 because of <br><br>
4.Nh4 g5, 5.Bg3 f4 <br><br> 
and the bishop is trapped.
Common continuations are  <br><br>
4.Bd2 e6, 5.c4 Nf6, 6.Nc3 Bb4 <br><br>
Black's idea is to prevent white to play e4. White typically develops the queen and castle long. 
White will gain an early initiative. Black has to respond and won't have time to castle soon.

White doesn't want to trade the bishop for a knight yet. Instead white can chase the knight 
on black's queen side around. 
This can be accomplished with <br><br>
4.d5 Na5, 5.b4 Nc4, 6.e4 Nb6 <br><br>
This is a very aggressive position in favor for white. However white is also over extended. 
Later on black can create counter play. White will continue to chase black's knights around. 
But black can win material. If black survives the attack, black will have an advantage in the endgame.
